# TBC-Assignment-33: SwiftUI-AccessibleNews App
TBC IT Academy | iOS development Course | Module 3 | Assignment #33

## Assignment Concept


The assignment aims to introduce us to SwiftUI-UIKit compatibility, focusing on incorporating UIKit code within a SwiftUI project using UIViewRepresentable. Additionally, it aims to integrate accessibility features into the app. All these should be unified within an Accessible News App that fetches news using the open-source [World News API](https://worldnewsapi.com/). The retrieved information is then displayed using a UITableView, seamlessly integrated into a SwiftUI View using UIViewRepresentable.


The assignment covers the following topics: 

* SwiftUI-UIKit Compatibility (UIViewRepresentable)
* Accessibility Features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Text) 
* Import Package Dependency (GenericNetworkManager)
* Make API Call
